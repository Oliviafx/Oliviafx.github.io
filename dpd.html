        <p class="blog-post-meta" style="text-align: center;"> June 12, 2020  </p>

        <p> I decided for my senior year to really be picky about the courses I was going to take. I wanted to make sure that any courses where I had flexibility in choosing what to take, that I really took courses that I valued or would have fun taking. </p>

        <p> I had heard about Introduction to Digital Product Design (DPD) from a few people in the previous semester when I mentioned to various friends of mine that I was interesting in learning more about design. DPD is a student run course run by the Cornell App Dev project team. It came really highly recommended to me as a good course to take, above any other courses offered from Cornell. </p>

        <p> I've always been interested in design and art - I have taken about a decade worth of art classes, and I found the visual nature of design to be appealing. I had no real training, so I decided that while I was in school, I would try to learn as much as I could about it. Additionally, my PM team at Microsoft did not have designers, so the work of designing mockups for our products fell on the shoulders of the PMs, much to my delight. I knew having even a bit more training would be beneficial for me in the long run. </p>

        <p> I absolutely loved this class. They take you through the entire process of human-centered design, starting from having everyone pick an app and then through the course of a semester, do a case study that would solve a people problem we found with the app.</p>

        <p> One of my favorite apps is Facebook Messenger - I use it daily, it syncs super nicely between my desktop and app, and I have an Android device, which means I have the bubbles to use. </p>
