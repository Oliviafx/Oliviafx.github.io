    <p class="lead" style="text-align: left;" > Hannah Cho's carefully planned out summer is starting to unravel - her boyfriend Nate breaks up with her with claims that they're nothing alike, leaving Hannah in confusion as everyone around her seems to be obsessed with K-pop and K-dramas. Further adding complications is her former best friend Jacob Kim, who is back in San Diego for the summer after moving to Korea to go star in a K-drama himself years ago. </p>

    <p class="lead" style="text-align: left;">  I enjoyed the development of their relationship through the bucket list that Jacob has, and I loved this look of San Diego that we get. </p>

    <p class="lead " style="text-align: left;"> I love the former best friendswho are now not-quite strangers dynamic, the way that Hannah and Jacob know all of each other's tells, the way they knew exactly how to hurt each other during arguments. I especially loved the intention and extra details that Hannah would look into when she would take Jacob places to eat due to his severe allergies.  </p>

    <img class="container-fluid" src="../dividers/shapes.png">

    <p class="lead" style="text-align: left;" > I really enjoyed the discussion around identity as Hannah and Jacob struggled in parallel ways as Korean Americans - Hannah feeling like she had to hide the Korean part of herself growing up to fit in, Jacob struggling to not feel "too American" to his fans and audiences in Korea. In particular as an Asian American, I emphathized with Hannah's anger at having "rejected" the parts of her culture to fit in and feeling a sort of whiplash when it seems to suddenly be accepted and even popular to enjoy these same things that would've gotten you bullied or ostracized as a kid. </p>

    <p class="lead" style="text-align: left;"> I loved Mrs. Cho, Mrs. Kim, and Jacob's sister, esepcially the family arcs in this book. I really liked how Hannah, who suffers from feeling abandoned by everyone in her life, ends up seeing some new perspectives on the situations from her mom. </p>

    <p class="lead " style="text-align: left;"> Thank you to Inkyard Press and NetGalley for the ARC. </p>

<p class="lead mt-5" style="text-align: left;font-size: 15px;"> <b>Title:</b>Seoulmates </p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align: left;font-size: 15px;"> <b>Author:</b> Susan Lee  </p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align: left;font-size: 15px;"> Hannah Cho had the next year all planned out—the perfect summer with her boyfriend, Nate, and then a fun senior year with their friends.
 </p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align: left;font-size: 15px;"> But then Nate does what everyone else in Hannah’s life seems to do—he leaves her, claiming they have nothing in common. He and all her friends are newly obsessed with K-pop and K-dramas, and Hannah is not. After years of trying to embrace the American part and shunning the Korean side of her Korean American identity to fit in, Hannah finds that’s exactly what now has her on the outs.
</p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align: left;font-size: 15px;"> But someone who does know K-dramas—so well that he’s actually starring in one—is Jacob Kim, Hannah’s former best friend, whom she hasn’t seen in years. He’s desperate for a break from the fame, so a family trip back to San Diego might be just what he needs…that is, if he and Hannah can figure out what went wrong when they last parted and navigate the new feelings developing between them. </p>
