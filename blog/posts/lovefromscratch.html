    <p class="lead" style="text-align: left;">  Reece Camden is landed her dream summer marketing internship at Friends of Flavor, a popular cooking channel. Her main competition for the fall job is Benny Beneventi, the charming culinary intern. When Reece and Benny get thrown together for a video shoot for Friends of Flavor that goes viral, Reece's plan to  keep Benny at a length begins to fail as audiences clamor for more content from the pair. </p>

    <p class="lead " style="text-align: left;"> I really loved Benny - he's a character that can best be described as "sunshin personified" and he was incredibly emotionally intelligent (especially for someone who is 18). His dates with Reece tended to be super sweet.</p>

    <p class="lead" style="text-align: left;" >  I really enjoyed all the other Friends at Friends of Flavor and wished that we got to see more of them. I also appreciated that this book didn't shy away from topics such as sexism in the workplace (especially in male-dominated fields) and online harassment.</p>

  </div>
  
</div>

    <p class="lead mt-3" style="text-align: left;">  However, I ended up being really taken out of the story by Reece's habit of self-sabotage. Even early on Benny offers to be an ally for her in the workplace - not even friends, just an ally - and Reece spurns his offer. By this time, we have already seen examples of higher-ups who behave inappropriately, and any sort of diversity and inclusion initiative will tell you that you want allies, esepcially if they are more privileged than you are, since they will often be heard more when they push back (and we see Benny push back as a good ally a few times). </p>

    <p class="lead " style="text-align: left;"> Other times, Reece and Benny would be on a cute date and moments of vulnerability from Benny are immediately twisted in Reece's mind  on how it would work against her (these were the times her "mental scoreboard" got particularly annoying - she was making up things that she perceived to be in favor of Benny, then using it as both an excuse to pull back from the relationship and adding it to her mental "woe is me" story that she built up in her head, almost like a shield to protect herself in the case she wouldn't get the fall internship). Actual moments of Reece facing adversity become immediately blown out of proportion in that Reece mentally starts accusing everyone from other Friends to even her manager to conspiring against her when there is literally zero evidence to support those thoughts. Even in her climactic argument with Benny, she immdiately assumes the worst out of everyone including her coworkers, and even when the truth comes out that she made completely incorrect assumptions, she still blames Benny for not understanding her, even though she had never told him what she wanted from him. Sorry he's not a mind reader. This took me out of the cute moments and made it hard for me to root for Reece and Benny's relationship.</p>

    <p class="lead mt-3" style="text-align: left;">Finally, I never understood why Reece wanted the fall culinary internship so badly - she admits several times that she enjoyed her marketing position and long-term wanted to stay behind the scenes in a similar role. Her justification for wanting the fall culinary role was that she wanted to "work her way up" at Friends of Flavor - but that makes no sense for her career to try to use a completely different role, you can't work your way up a marketing ladder using a culingary role! On top of that, she shows genuine excitement and talent in marketing pretty early on, which then gets completely overshadowed by her jealousy and competitive streak at Benny when Benny is the better cook than she is, which makes sense since Benny was hired for the culinary role and that was what he wanted to do! Between this and Reece's self-sabotage, I couldn't even root for her to get that fall internship. </p>


    <p class="lead " style="text-align: left;"> Overall, this book had a lot of cute moments and tackles some pretty serious topics, but I think it just wasn't for me. I can see a lot of people who would enjoy this book though.</p>

    <p class="lead " style="text-align: left;"> A thank you to Random House Children's, Delacorte Press, and NetGalley for the ARC.  </p>

<p class="lead mt-5" style="text-align: left;font-size: 15px;"> <b>Title:</b>Love From Scratch</p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align: left;font-size: 15px;"> <b>Author:</b> Kaitlyn Hill </p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align: left;font-size: 15px;"> This summer, Reese Camden is trading sweet tea and Southern hospitality for cold brew and crisp coastal air. She's landed her dream marketing internship at Friends of Flavor, a wildly popular cooking channel in Seattle. The only problem? Benny Beneventi, the relentlessly charming, backwards-baseball-cap-wearing culinary intern--and her main competition for the fall job.
 </p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align: left;font-size: 15px;"> Reese's plan to keep work a No Feelings Zone crumbles like a day-old muffin when she and Benny are thrown together for a video shoot that goes viral, making them the internet's newest ship. Audiences are hungry for more, and their bosses at Friends of Flavor are happy to deliver. Soon Reese and Benny are in an all-out food war, churning homemade ice cream, twisting soft pretzels, breaking eggs in an omelet showdown--while hundreds of thousands of viewers watch.
 </p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align: left;font-size: 15px;"> Reese can't deny the chemistry between her and Benny. But the more their rivalry heats up, the harder it is to keep love on the back burner...  </p>
