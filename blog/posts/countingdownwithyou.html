    <p class="lead" style="text-align: left;" > I've been following Tashie for some time on Twitter now, so this was one of my anticipated reads of this year. Unfortunately, this missed the mark for me.  </p>

    <p class="lead" style="text-align: left;">  Karina Ahmed is in her junior year and she wants to do nothing more than to make her parents proud of her, even if it means being unhappy herself. While her parents are gone on a month-long trip to Bangladesh, she hopes to have a second to breath. However, when she agrees first to tutor then to fake-date Ace Clyde, her carefully built life slowly begins to unravel. Although reluctant at first, Karina soon can't help but begin to count down the days until her parents return and this slice of happiness will be taken from her.</p>

    <img class="container-fluid" src="../dividers/books.gif">

    <p class="lead " style="text-align: left;"> What this book does well is with the anxiety representation. Karina has anxiety, and I really liked seeing the variety of things that she would try to do in order to try to cope with her anxiety, as well as the commentary on how there is a stigma around mental health and ways to cope with anxiety. I also enjoyed the growth arc between Karina and her brother Samir, which I found to be super satisfying and relatable.</p>

    <p class="lead " style="text-align: left;"> The writing quality has a lot of pop culture and slang references that makes me think this book will feel dated even in a year or two. The main conflicts that Karina faces in regards to her parents either were never really addressed, or were so neatly tied up in a way that I had trouble believing it - especially since her parents were quite toxic in how they talked to Karina, even if they belived they were doing it for the best, those sorts of biting comments are probably an ingrained habit that doesn't go away that easily. I also did get some white-savior-y type vibes while reading it, which made me feel a bit icky. It's hard to describe, but it just doesn't feel at the same level compared to some of the other debut books I've read this year. I found myself continuously getting distracted and stopping reading it, which doesn't happen too often to me. The author is young so I'm hopeful that future books will continue to improve and grow, as I've seen some of her other announced projects and their concepts seem interesting to me as well. </p>

    <p class="lead " style="text-align: left;"> Finally, a lot of Bangladeshi and Muslim ownvoices reviewers have pointed out that there is a lot of misrepresentation of Islam and Bagladeshi culture. I'm not part of those groups, so I can't speak on that representation, but here are some reviews that explain some of the issues: <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3683609366?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1" style="color:#F7CAC9;">Nana on goodreads</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3985129050?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1" style="color:#F7CAC9;">razan on goodreads</a>.</strong> </p>

    <p class="lead " style="text-align: left;"> All in all, a fast read that was just alright. </p>

<p class="lead mt-5" style="text-align: left;font-size: 15px;"> <b>Title:</b> Counting Down with You </p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align: left;font-size: 15px;"> <b>Author:</b> Tashie Bhuiyan  </p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align: left;font-size: 15px;"> Karina Ahmed has a plan. Keep her head down, get through high school without a fuss, and follow her parents’ rules—even if it means sacrificing her dreams. When her parents go abroad to Bangladesh for four weeks, Karina expects some peace and quiet. Instead, one simple lie unravels everything. </p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align: left;font-size: 15px;"> Karina is my girlfriend.</p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align: left;font-size: 15px;"> Tutoring the school’s resident bad boy was already crossing a line. Pretending to date him? Out of the question. But Ace Clyde does everything right—he brings her coffee in the mornings, impresses her friends without trying, and even promises to buy her a dozen books (a week) if she goes along with his fake-dating facade. Though Karina agrees, she can’t help but start counting down the days until her parents come back. </p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align: left;font-size: 15px;"> T-minus twenty-eight days until everything returns to normal—but what if Karina no longer wants it to? </p>
