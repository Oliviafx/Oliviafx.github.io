    <p class="lead" style="text-align: left;" >This is the book that I needed when I was younger. </p>

    <p class="lead" style="text-align: left;"> Zachary Ying hasn't really learned about the stories related to his Chinese heritage. He's busy trying to survive middle school, somewhere he already feels out of place as one of the few Asian Americans there, and playing Mythrealm, a game on his AR headset. However, when the First Emperor of China possesses his AR headset and Zack's mom's soul gets taken by demons, Zack has to journey across China to save his mom and prevent all the spirits from the underworld from flooding the mortal realm.  </p>

    <p class="lead" style="text-align: left;"> I loved that Zachary is Hui Chinese (a minority ethnic group) and Muslim. I absolutely loved the relationship between Zack, Melissa, and Simon. The way that the Qin Shihuang, Wu Zetian, and Tang Taizong's characters interacted with each other and with the children was also hilarious. </p>

    <img class="container-fluid" src="../dividers/chinese.png">

    <p class="lead" style="text-align: left;">The way that Chinese historical events and Chinese mythology blended together with the sci-fi aspect of AR technology was  really well done. I enjoyed reading about references to stories and other small pieces of Chinese culture that I grew up with - Sun Wukong, Nezha, the poems of Li Bai, the dragon boat festival - on and on, this book made me smile at all the pieces of familiarity brought to life in a new adventure.</p>

    <p class="lead" style="text-align: left;" > Since the basis of this story includes a few famous emperors throughout Chinese history (as revived by legends of their lives), there's a lot of great commentary on what it means to be good versus bad, especially as a leader.  All of these leaders did terrible and great things, all in different ways, and I'm glad that there was plenty of exploration on that front.</p>

    <p class="lead" style="text-align: left;">And the cliffhanger! I can't wait to read the next book in the series.</p>

    <p class="lead " style="text-align: left;"> A thank you to Simon and Schuster Children's Publishing, Margaret K. McElderry Books, and NetGalley for the ARC. </p>

<p class="lead mt-5" style="text-align: left;font-size: 15px;"> <b>Title:</b>Zachary Ying and the Dragon Emperor</p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align: left;font-size: 15px;"> <b>Author:</b> Xiran Jay Zhao  </p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align: left;font-size: 15px;"> Zachary Ying never had many opportunities to learn about his Chinese heritage. His single mom was busy enough making sure they got by, and his schools never taught anything except Western history and myths. So Zack is woefully unprepared when he discovers he was born to host the spirit of the First Emperor of China for a vital mission: sealing the leaking portal to the Chinese underworld before the upcoming Ghost Month blows it wide open.
 </p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align: left;font-size: 15px;">The mission takes an immediate wrong turn when the First Emperor botches his attempt to possess Zack’s body and binds to Zack’s AR gaming headset instead, leading to a battle where Zack’s mom’s soul gets taken by demons. Now, with one of history’s most infamous tyrants yapping in his headset, Zack must journey across China to heist magical artifacts and defeat figures from history and myth, all while learning to wield the emperor’s incredible water dragon powers.
 </p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align: left;font-size: 15px;">And if Zack can’t finish the mission in time, the spirits of the underworld will flood into the mortal realm, and he could lose his mom forever.</p>
