    <p class="lead" style="text-align: left;" > I had been following the blog posts that Meg Cabot had been posting during the early stages of the pandemic, so I was pretty interested in reading this book, even though I don't really have much interest in reading pandemic books in general.</p>

    <p class="lead" style="text-align: left;"> Follow Mia as she attempts to navigate leading a country through the COVID-19 pandemic, complete with dealing with lockdown with her entire family and cameos from all our favorite characters from previous books.</p>

    <img class="container-fluid" src="../images/princessdiaries.gif" style="width: 50%;">

    <p class="lead mt-5" style="text-align: left;"> Overall, this was a pretty lighthearted, nostalgic read. I enjoyed the feeling that you were catching up with these characters as Mia had to navigate the progressively more ridculous situations that her friends (and sometimes her) would get themselves into. </p>

    <p class="lead " style="text-align: left;"> However, while there were many challenges that Mia faced that were based in real-life problems (anti-maskers, anti-vaxxers, and protesters on mandates) that were resolved in a very fairytale-esque way. If you're looking for something more realistic, this book might not be for you. </p>

    <p class="lead " style="text-align: left;"> A thank you to Avon and Harper Voyager, Avon Impulse, and NetGalley for the ARC.</p>

<p class="lead mt-5" style="text-align: left;font-size: 15px;"> <b>Title:</b>The Quarantine Princess Diaries </p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align: left;font-size: 15px;"> <b>Author:</b> Meg Cabot </p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align: left;font-size: 15px;"> During the Covid-19 pandemic, a section of the diary of Princess Mia Thermopolis of Genovia fell into the hands of Meg Cabot, the Princess’s royal biographer. </p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align: left;font-size: 15px;"> In these entries, titled The Coronavirus Princess Diaries, the princess recorded her most heartfelt emotions while dealing with her husband’s quarantine after exposure to the virus; her personal (and political) battles while imposing health restrictions on her small European nation; life during lockdown (even in as idyllic a location as a palace on the Riviera); and of course, dealing with her demanding royal family, especially her grandmother.
</p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align: left;font-size: 15px;"> Since then, readers have been clamoring for more chapters of Mia’s coronavirus diary . . . and here they are at last: The Quarantine Princess Diaries include not only the previously released entries (now edited and updated with new content), but two hundred more pages of entirely original, never-before-seen entries, including the princess’s worries over a possible royal affair; a showdown between Mia and Grandmère over the latter’s intended nuptials; the eventual development and distribution of a groundbreaking intranasal vaccine for every citizen in Genovia; and, as always, a royally happy ending.
