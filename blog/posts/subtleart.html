    <p class="lead mt-5" style="text-align: left;" > I've been feeling a bit discontent recently, and I had a friend that recommended this book. It has been on my TBR for a while, so I decided to take a break this weekend and try to see if it lives up to my expectations. </p>

    <img class="container-fluid" src="../dividers/books.png">

    <p class="lead" style="text-align: left;">  On one hand, this book does frame a lot of things very well. In particular, I did like how he pointed out that part of the issue with the "positive thinking" way of life is that a lot of times, it just points out all the things that you don't have, which in turns <i>can</i> lead to being unhappier overall. After all, as Manson pointed out, no one who is <i>truly</i> happy wakes up every morning and looks in the mirror and says "I'm happy".</p>

    <p class="lead" style="text-align: left;">The main argument that Manson makes is that everyone will give a f*ck about something in their life, and it is both figuring out what exactly those values are as well as <i>how you measure how well you are achieving those values that you choose</i> is what's important. This new framing was interesting to me, as I had never really thought about actually <i>measuring</i> my values. This was new insight for me, and I appreciated that. </p>

    <img class="container" src="../images/priorities.gif" style="width: 50%;">

    <p class="lead mt-5" style="text-align: left;"> However, there were quite a few places that I wasn't really a fan of. There was a chapter about how there are fake memories that can be created. While this phenomena is actually true, when presented in a format of how a women made a falsified memory about getting sexual abused by her father, then follows it with facts about how hundreds of people had been wrongly imprisoned at that time. Do I believe that to be true? Yes. Do I also think that this was a reckless way of presenting this information, <i>almost</i> accusing victims of sexual assault to be falsifying their memories? Yes. Besides, Manson's main point, that your brain will often be very unreliable, could easily be made with different examples. I'm pretty sure that Manson choose this example in particular in part by the shock value. </p>


    <p class="lead" style="text-align: left;"> Another annoyance I had was that when it came to actually choosing your values, Manson had no real advice there to give. In fact, he even states in the book that when asked "how?", he just tells people to do it. What does that even mean? If you're telling people that they need to re-think their values <strong>and</strong> naming your book <i>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck</i>, maybe you should actually help people out with this subtle art in particular, rather than just saying that this art exists. </p>

    <p class="lead" style="text-align: left;"> Finally, there were just some random comments and things brought up with Manson that I just found tiring as I was reading through the book. His entire rant about participation trophies and snowflakes, the way that he kept bringing up how much he just went through girls super quickly, a brief mention of readers probably wanting to feel up Jennifer Aniston's boobs (???), etc. that just made me frown while reading this (and this is someone who didn't bat an eye at all the profanity). I want to say if this were a slower read, I might've stopped reading at some points. </p>

    <p class="lead" style="text-align: left;"> Overall, some pretty reasonable advice mixed in with some pretty weird comments and presented in a way that feels a bit like it's for shock factor. It has given me a lot to think about in terms of organizing my own life, so it did fulfill my goal for reading it. However, there were enough ways that felt a bit reckless or arrogant or straight up misogynistic that I can't give this higher than three stars. </p>

<p class="lead mt-5" style="text-align: left;font-size: 15px;"> <b>Title:</b> The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*uck: A Counterintuitive approach to Living a Good Life </p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align: left;font-size: 15px;"> <b>Author:</b>  Mark Manson </p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align: left;font-size: 15px;"> For decades, we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. "F**k positivity," Mark Manson says. "Let’s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it." In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up. </p>
