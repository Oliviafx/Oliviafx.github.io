<p class="lead mt-5" style="text-align: left;"> <b>Title:</b> On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft </p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align: left;"> <b>Author:</b> Stephen King </p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align: left;"> Part memoir, part master class by one of the bestselling authors of all time, this superb volume is a revealing and practical view of the writer's craft, comprising the basic tools of the trade every writer must have. King's advice is grounded in his vivid memories from childhood through his emergence as a writer, from his struggling early career to his widely reported near-fatal accident in 1999 -- and how the inextricable link between writing and living spurred his recovery. </p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align: left;"><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10569.On_Writing" target="_blank"  style="color:#F7CAC9;">Find on Goodreads here.</a></strong></p>

</div> <!--About the book-->

<div class="container row mt-5">
    <p class="lead" style="text-align: left;" > I've been looking for a craft book for a while to improve on my writing. This was a title that came up again and again when it came to trying to improve storytelling, so I decided to see what it was about. </p>

    <p class="lead" style="text-align: left;"> The first part of the book is a bit of memoir of Stephen King's life. I found this was a good basis to ground myself in King, as I am not typically a horror person, so while I'm familiar with some of his most popular titles and their overall concept, I wasn't actually very familiar with Stephen King. Having him lay out his journey for me from his childhood to getting his first manuscript published to where he is now was enlightening. I loved hearing about how he will have a small circle of close friends that'll give him first reactions, but his most trusted one is his wife Tabitha. </p>

    <p class="lead " style="text-align: left;"> The craft part of the book is where it really shines. He goes from things like spelling and grammar to why you should look towards situtations rather than plot. There's a lot of good advice here that can be taken to aspiring writers. I also liked how he emphasized that you need to both read a lot and write a lot if you want to be a writer, which is advice that I don't think is given a lot. </p>

    <p class="lead " style="text-align: left;">I can't wait to read it again.</p>
